Dan has been an entrepreneur in both North America and Africa. For many years he has served as a business bridge between Ghanaian expatriates and his home country where his father is a local chieftain. He plays an active role in the Ghanaian Canadian Association and the Yayra-Si Youth Foundation, which seeks to improve the economic and health outcomes for women and youth in rural Ghana.

Dan has worked closely with politicians and chiefs in Ghana, serving as a trusted advisor to achieve various economic development and community-building goals. His local business experience and wide network of contacts makes him the ideal management team member to conduct our market research and lead the country-wide implementation of Landano in Ghana and beyond.
