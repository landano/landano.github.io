Nana is the University Ambassador for Wada and the Blockchain Education Network (BEN) in Accra, Ghana. Amongst his responsibilities are delivering workshops to explain Cardano blockchain technology to newcomers. His presentations are grounded in a deep knowledge of Ghanian history and culture for which he is an eloquent advocate.

Nana has witnessed first-hand the tragic and sometimes violent effects of expensive, mismanaged, and corruptible land registry processes in Ghana. He is optimistic that Landano provides a significant step towards a more equitable and accessible alternative.
