Aaron is a land policy professional who has worked as an urban planner and designer, researcher, market analyst, land developer and surveyor in a variety of cultures and jurisdictions. In Abu Dhabi, he developed the first, values-based evaluation system for US$640b of land use change proposals for the second-fastest growing city in the world. In Canada, he led a boundary survey on traditional Heiltsuk First Nation land to resolve a dispute with a logging company.

As a land use regulator he has served the public from neighbourhood to national scale in three countries, on two continents. As an advisor and entrepreneur he has led or collaborated with multi-national teams to implement often groundbreaking development projects and policies. Aaron enjoys the challenge of juggling budget, schedule, environment, geography, and culture into ambitious and transformative deliverables like those being developed by the Landano project.
