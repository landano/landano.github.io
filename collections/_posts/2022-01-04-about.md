Landano allows property owners to manage land records for their real estate property via an easy-to-use, decentralized app ([dApp](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-dapp)) and our Open Cadastral Map initiative.

Landano is a true, Africa-focused "[RealFi](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/25/welcome-to-the-age-of-realfi/)" solution that is informed by on-the-ground requirements from pilot projects in Ghana, Mozambique, and Kenya.

Land records are notarized on the [Cardano]( __GHOST_URL__ /why-the-cardano-blockchain/) blockchain as NFT documents. Using a shared, auditable ledger like the Cardano blockchain improves transparency and prevents fraud. Combined with standards-based record-keeping features, Landano land records can be used as trustworthy DeFi primitives for mortgages, business loans, leases, etc..

Landano B.V. is a limited company registered in The Netherlands. It conducts all corporate affairs on behalf of the Landano project. See our [team page](https://landano.io/team/).
