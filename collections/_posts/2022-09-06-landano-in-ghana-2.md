Landano has been building partnership in Ghana with [Wada](https://wada.org), [ILAPI](https://ilapi.org/), and village elders in the Ashanti region. We recently completed a village boundary survey to contribute valuable cadastral data to the local Lands Commission office. Our geospatial engineer Abdul Razak led the project and compiled this highlight video.
