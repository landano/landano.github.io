### Peter Van Garderen  
Co-founder & Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

Peter is a professional archivist, software developer, and a world-renowned expert in the field of digital records management. He is the creator of the industry-leading [Archivematica](https://archivematica.org) and [AccessToMemory](https://accesstomemory.org) open-source software projects which are used by hundreds of government agencies and memory institutions worldwide to preserve access to trustworthy digital archives.

Peter worked on several international development projects early in his career and was inspired when the economist Hernando De Soto 's book "The Mystery of Capitalism" began to be debated in these circles. He has thought often about its core thesis since then; the idea that impoverished people remain so largely because they can't register the title on their legally-owned property. This documentation problem is tailor-made for an archives-based solution which Peter is highly qualified and keen to deliver via the Landano project.
