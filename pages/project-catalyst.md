## WHAT IS PROJECT CATALYST?
Project Catalyst is an innovative part of the Cardano blockchain, functioning as a community-driven fund and a platform for decentralized innovation. It allows ADA holders to propose, discuss, and vote on various projects aimed at improving and expanding the Cardano ecosystem. This democratic approach to governance and funding enables the Cardano community to directly influence the network's development. By participating in Project Catalyst, stakeholders can support initiatives that align with their vision for the blockchain, fostering a more vibrant and collaborative environment for growth and advancement within the Cardano ecosystem.

## THE THREE LANDANO FUND 11 CATALYST PROPOSALS

Introducing three transformative proposals at the intersection of Cardano and real-world solutions. The first, the Cardano Mendix plug-in by the Landano team, aims to make Cardano accessible to developers through Mendix's low-code platform. The second proposal focuses on mapping RealFi DID requirements to Cardano-based solutions, paving the way for a secure decentralized identity system. Lastly, we embark on launching Landano on the Cardano Mainnet, where legal land rights management becomes a reality through Cardano NFTs. Together, these proposals highlight Cardano's potential to revolutionize the global south.

## <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112624" target="_blank">Cardano Mendix plug-in by the Landano team</a>

*Category:* Cardano Open: Developers<br>
*Summary:*<br> Cardano's ecosystem needs easy-to-use off-chain dev tools to attract enterprise participation. Mendix’s low-code platform is an ideal fit but there are currently no Mendix plugins or SDKs for Cardano. Funding this proposal will result in wider access for developers to Cardano, and more real-world use cases taking advantage of Cardano’s utility.

## <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/113510" target="_blank">Mapping RealFi DID requirements to Cardano-based solutions</a>

*Category:* Cardano Use Cases: Concept<br>
*Summary:*<br> RealFi projects like Landano need decentralized solutions for identity and credentials which can be used by users globally. However, system requirements and available solutions aren’t yet understood. This proposal’s outcome will be a set of guidelines, protocols, and best practices for implementing a consistent, secure, transferable decentralized identity solution within the Cardano ecosystem (and, conceivably, on other blockchains).

## <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/113641" target="_blank">Launching Landano on Cardano Mainnet</a>

*Category:* Cardano Use Cases: Solution<br>
*Summary:*<br> Landano’s pilots, market analysis and customer feedback in Ghana and Mozambique resulted in a prototype demonstrating legal land rights management via Cardano NFT minting. To continue this progress, if funded, this proposal will develop this into a viably functional land-record storage and administration product to launch on Cardano Mainnet.
