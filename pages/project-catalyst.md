## THE THREE LANDANO FUND 11 CATALYST PROPOSALS
### <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112624" target="_blank">Cardano Mendix plug-in by the Landano team</a>

*Category:* Cardano Open: Developers<br>
*Summary:* Cardano's ecosystem needs easy-to-use off-chain dev tools to attract enterprise participation. Mendix’s low-code platform is an ideal fit but there are currently no Mendix plugins or SDKs for Cardano. Funding this proposal will result in wider access for developers to Cardano, and more real-world use cases taking advantage of Cardano’s utility.

### <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/113510" target="_blank">Mapping RealFi DID requirements to Cardano-based solutions</a>

*Category:* Cardano Use Cases: Concept<br>
*Summary:* RealFi projects like Landano need decentralized solutions for identity and credentials which can be used by users globally. However, system requirements and available solutions aren’t yet understood. This proposal’s outcome will be a set of guidelines, protocols, and best practices for implementing a consistent, secure, transferable decentralized identity solution within the Cardano ecosystem (and, conceivably, on other blockchains).

### <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/113641" target="_blank">Launching Landano on Cardano Mainnet</a>

*Category:* Cardano Use Cases: Solution<br>
*Summary:* Landano’s pilots, market analysis and customer feedback in Ghana and Mozambique resulted in a prototype demonstrating legal land rights management via Cardano NFT minting. To continue this progress, if funded, this proposal will develop this into a viably functional land-record storage and administration product to launch on Cardano Mainnet.

## VOTING GUIDE

Becoming a voter is a great way to actually utilize the ADA that you hold in your wallet. It enables you to vote on ideas and proposals that propel the Cardano community.

### STEP 1: MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

You should have a minimum of 500 ADA in your wallet “excluding rewards” (that have not been claimed).

If you currently don't have 500 ADA, you can acquire ADA from one of the many crypto exchanges. After acquiring your ADA make sure to send it to a [wallet that supports voting](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/fund-documentation/fund11-docs/how-to-register-as-a-voter/wallet-registration-guide/supported-wallets).

### STEP 2: DOWNLOAD THE LATEST VOTING APP

Make sure your wallet is included in this [list](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/fund-documentation/fund11-docs/how-to-register-as-a-voter/wallet-registration-guide/supported-wallets)

<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

    </tr>

### STEP 3: GENERATE A QR CODE AND PIN

Follow your wallet-specific guidelines for voting registration, inside the wallet; [here](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005679386-Catalyst-registration-and-voting-guide) is a walk-through for Daedalus.

> NOTE: Make sure you capture both the QR Code as well as the PIN.<br>
> No QR Code, No Voting, No Pin, No Voting.

### STEP 4: CONNECT YOUR WALLET IN THE CATALYST VOTING APP

Open the voting app. In the voting app you'll see a button "CONNECT WALLET". Tap this button and follow the instructions on screen.

> NOTE: Make sure to have completed this step before the registration closes on Jan 15th, 2024 21:45 UTC

### STEP 5: VOTE FOR LANDANO

From Jan 25th, 2024 11:00 UTC the voting starts. In the app go to the Proposals tab and lookup the Landano proposals one-by-one. Give us a thumbs up when you like our proposals. After that, make sure to cast your votes via the Votes tab in the application.

## HAPPY VOTING!
