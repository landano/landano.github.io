# Revolutionizing Land Record Management with Landano

Landano is revolutionizing the way real estate property owners manage their land records with a user-friendly, decentralized app (dApp) and an innovative initiative called the Open Cadastral Map. Our platform offers a true “RealFi” solution for property owners in Africa that has been tailored to meet the specific needs of the continent. Our on-the-ground pilot projects in Ghana, Mozambique, and Kenya have given us unique insights into the challenges faced by real estate owners in Africa, and we have used this knowledge to build a solution that truly meets their needs.

## Streamlined and Secure Land Record Management

At Landano, we understand that managing land records can be a daunting task, particularly in regions where record-keeping practices are not standardized. This is why we have implemented a notarization process that leverages the power of the Cardano blockchain to create NFT documents that are immutable and auditable. This technology ensures that your land records are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, and it eliminates the risk of fraud or corruption that can arise when records are managed manually.

## Standards-based Record-Keeping Features

With Landano, you can trust that your land records will be kept up-to-date and organized. Our platform includes standards-based record-keeping features that allow you to easily manage your land records, including mortgages, business loans, leases, and more. And because our land records are stored on a shared, auditable ledger, you can use them as trustworthy DeFi primitives. This means that you can leverage your land records to secure financing for your business, take out a mortgage, or negotiate a lease with confidence.

## Trusted Platform and Experienced Team

Landano is a limited company registered in The Netherlands, and we conduct all corporate affairs on behalf of the Landano project. Our team is comprised of experienced professionals who are passionate about using technology to empower real estate owners in Africa.
