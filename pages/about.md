# Landano Text
Landano is revolutionizing the way real estate property owners manage their land records with a user-friendly, decentralized app (dApp) and an innovative initiative called the Open Cadastral Map. With Landano, property owners in Africa can access a true "RealFi" solution that has been tailored to meet the specific needs of the continent. How do we know this? Our on-the-ground pilot projects in Ghana, Mozambique, and Kenya have given us unique insights into the challenges faced by real estate owners in Africa, and we have used this knowledge to build a solution that truly meets their needs.

At Landano, we understand that managing land records can be a daunting task, particularly in regions where record-keeping practices are not standardized. This is why we have implemented a notarization process that leverages the power of the Cardano blockchain to create NFT documents that are immutable and auditable. This technology ensures that your land records are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof, and it eliminates the risk of fraud or corruption that can arise when records are managed manually.

With Landano, you can trust that your land records will be kept up-to-date and organized. Our platform includes standards-based record-keeping features that allow you to easily manage your land records, including mortgages, business loans, leases, and more. And because our land records are stored on a shared, auditable ledger, you can use them as trustworthy DeFi primitives. This means that you can leverage your land records to secure financing for your business, take out a mortgage, or negotiate a lease with confidence.

Landano is a limited company registered in The Netherlands, and we conduct all corporate affairs on behalf of the Landano project. Our team is comprised of experienced professionals who are passionate about using technology to empower real estate owners in Africa. If you want to learn more about Landano, visit our team page or check out our FAQ section. We are always happy to answer any questions you may have about our platform or our mission to transform land record-keeping in Africa.

# Creating Modern Websites

Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.

Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development.

## What is Web Design?

User experience is about how a user interacts with, and experiences, a particular product, system or service. As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.

## Front-end Development

The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.

Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

## Design Systems

A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized to aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites.

## Process

There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page.

- User experience research
- Visual design and illustration
- Programming and coding

Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.
