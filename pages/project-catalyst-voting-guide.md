## VOTING GUIDE

Becoming a voter is a great way to actually utilize the ADA that you hold in your wallet. It enables you to vote on ideas and proposals that propel the Cardano community.

### STEP 1: MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

You should have a minimum of 500 ADA in your wallet “excluding rewards” (that have not been claimed).

If you currently don't have 500 ADA, you can acquire ADA from one of the many crypto exchanges. After acquiring your ADA make sure to send it to a [wallet that supports voting](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/fund-documentation/fund11-docs/how-to-register-as-a-voter/wallet-registration-guide/supported-wallets).

### STEP 2: DOWNLOAD THE LATEST VOTING APP

Make sure your wallet is included in this [list](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/fund-documentation/fund11-docs/how-to-register-as-a-voter/wallet-registration-guide/supported-wallets)

<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

        <td style="padding-right: 20px; text-align='center';"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/en/app/catalyst-voting/id1517473397?l=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="assets/images/gen/catalyst/download_on_the_app_store_qr.png" width="150px" height="150px" style="margin: 0"></a></td>

    </tr>

### STEP 3: GENERATE A QR CODE AND PIN

Follow your wallet-specific guidelines for voting registration, inside the wallet; [here](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005679386-Catalyst-registration-and-voting-guide) is a walk-through for Daedalus.

> NOTE: Make sure you capture both the QR Code as well as the PIN.<br>
> No QR Code, No Voting, No Pin, No Voting.

### STEP 4: CONNECT YOUR WALLET IN THE CATALYST VOTING APP

Open the voting app. In the voting app you'll see a button "CONNECT WALLET". Tap this button and follow the instructions on screen.

> NOTE: Make sure to have completed this step before the registration closes on Jun 18th, 2024 21:45 UTC

### STEP 5: VOTE FOR LANDANO

From Jun 27th, 2024 12:00 UTC the voting starts and will continue until July 11, 2024, at 11:00 UTC. In the app go to the Proposals tab and lookup the Landano proposals one-by-one. Give us a thumbs up when you like our proposals. After that, make sure to cast your votes via the Votes tab in the application.

In the voting app go to the Proposals tab and select the "Cardano Use Cases: Solution" category. In the "Search Proposal" box type "Launching". Our Launching Landano on Cardano Mainnet proposal will appear. Click the proposal link and the green "Vote Yes" button.
