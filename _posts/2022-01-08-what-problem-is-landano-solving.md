Marginalized people may own land but they lack financial capital. If they do not have authentic land title deeds that prove their ownership, then they cannot use their real estate property as a stepping stone into the traditional financial system. It is estimated that up to 1 billion legitimate land owners around the world do not hold legal title documentation for their own property.

This is a major blocker to their upward financial mobility as trustworthy deed documents can otherwise be used in applications for a bank account, credit score reports, mortgages, or lines-of-credit.

Moreover, trustworthy land ownership records are a foundational layer for peaceful nation building and the rule of law. To individual owners, these land title records nurture a pride of ownership that enables a sense of psychological and physical security.

However, acquiring legally-binding land title deeds can be fraught with missteps due to expensive, mismanaged, confusing, or corrupted processes and systems. For example, a single plot of land may be registered to several different names and sold to different people behind the true owner's back.

There have been other blockchain-based land registry projects. However, these have failed to bridge the gap between real world evidentiary requirements and authentic documents that no longer depend on a trusted third party or centralized servers. Landano is addressing this concern with its [innovative design]( __GHOST_URL__ /what-does-landano-do/).

Another reason that other projects have stalled is because they were tested in jurisdictions that already had "good enough" land registry systems rather than jurisdictions where they could have the broadest positive impact.

The Landano project will make land title registration as simple, cost-effective, and reliable as possible for those marginalized people who need it most. This will enable new economic opportunities like credit financing, rental income, and decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835)).
