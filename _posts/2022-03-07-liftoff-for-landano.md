We were awarded a seed funding round by Cardano's Project Catalyst. Our project [team](https://landano.io/team/) has jumped into action to start delivering on the Landano [roadmap]( __GHOST_URL__ /roadmap/) over the coming months.

Our first couple of weeks have been focussed on project management and team organization, including the configuration of lots of accounts and tools. We have been preparing a ground team in Ghana to go out and meet potential users and we are incorporating a legal entity in the Netherlands as _Landano B.V.._

We want to help marginalized landowners arounds the world [verify ownership]( __GHOST_URL__ /what-does-landano-do/) of their real estate property. We are especially focussed on rural farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, starting with pilot projects in Ghana, Africa.   
  
We are making the complex process of proving your land ownership more convenient and trustworthy. This can be a critical turning point in establishing financial stability. It forms the basis for financial credibility to acquire traditional mortgages and loans. Landano users will also access innovative new [DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) opportunities backed by their registered land records.
